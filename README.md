# LangSmith

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)** across different levels of LLM application complexity ‚Äî starting from simple projects, moving into sequential chains, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, agent workflows, and finally into advanced **LangGraph**-based orchestration.  

The examples show how to **trace and monitor** not only `Runnable` objects but also custom functions, tools, and complete workflows using LangSmith‚Äôs built-in **tracing and observability features**.

## üöÄ What is LangSmith?
[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) is a platform for:
- **Tracing**: Capturing execution details of chains, agents, tools, and custom code.
- **Debugging**: Inspecting intermediate steps, inputs, outputs, and errors.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring performance, latency, and quality of LLM applications.
- **Monitoring**: Observing tokens, costs, and metadata in production.

By wrapping your LLM application with LangSmith, you gain full visibility into how data flows through your pipelines ‚Äî from input ‚Üí intermediate steps ‚Üí output.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repo is organized to progressively show how LangSmith integrates into increasingly complex systems:

### 1. **Basic LLM Project**
- Traces a simple `Runnable` (e.g., an LLM call).
- Demonstrates how to capture inputs, outputs, and metadata.

### 2. **Sequential Chains**
- Combines multiple steps into a pipeline.
- Shows LangSmith tracing for the entire chain, including intermediate function calls.

### 3. **RAG-based Chatbot**
- Integrates LangSmith into a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** chatbot.
- Demonstrates:
  - Tracing custom functions using the `@traceable` decorator.
  - Monitoring entire workflows from top to bottom.
  - Adding a **vector index** for similarity search to improve retrieval speed and relevance.
  - Capturing inputs, retrieved documents, and final responses.

### 4. **Agent Workflows**
- Shows LangSmith integration with agents that use external tools.
- Example: An agent with two tools ‚Äî **search** and **weather fetcher**.
- LangSmith records each tool invocation, intermediate reasoning, and final answers.

### 5. **Complex LangGraph Workflows**
- Demonstrates LangSmith in a **LangGraph** (stateful workflow orchestration) setup
- Branching logic and intermediate node activity  
- Provides **end-to-end observability** for complex multi-agent or multi-step workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts Used

- **`Runnable`**: Core abstraction in LangChain for composable building blocks.
- **`@traceable` decorator**: Used to wrap custom Python functions so LangSmith can trace them like standard LangChain components.
- **LangSmith Client & Tracer**: The bridge between your application and the LangSmith platform.
- **Vector Index for RAG**: Used to perform fast similarity search before answering questions.
- **Agents & Tools**: Demonstrates how LangSmith traces every tool invocation and decision made by an agent.
- **LangGraph**: Enables advanced workflows with branching, memory, and state ‚Äî all monitored by LangSmith.
